# Sound Mixer

## Model

The sound mixer used in Kistan is smaller version of the X32 mixer series made
for rack mounting. The mixer has 16 XLR inputs and 8 XLR outputs. Additionally,
it has 6 in/out channels as 6.3 mm jacks (with some RCA optional). These can be
either in or out.

The sound mixer is usually controlled using the official X32-Edit software
available on the bar-computer.
