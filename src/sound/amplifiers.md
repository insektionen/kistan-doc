# Sound Amplifiers

## Power

Power to all amplifiers are controlled using a DMX relay board. It is mounted
inside the server rack in the back bottom half. The DMX network needs to be
working to turn on the relays.

Automatic script running is done to turn off amplifiers at night. This prolongs
the life of the amplifiers and reduces white noise in Kistan.
